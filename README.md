# Flight-Delay-Analysis-in-ML
“Flight Delay Predictions” is a supervised machine learning project. The primary goal of this  project is to predict airline delays caused by various factors. Flight delays lead to negative  impacts, mainly economical for commuters, airline industries and airport authorities.  Furthermore, in the domain of sustainability, it can even cause environmental harm by the rise in  fuel consumption and gas emissions.  Here we train a regression model to predict if a flight will be delayed by more than 15  minutes. The model was trained using features of the flights known at the time of booking such  as the airline, month, week, and hour of departure. This report will help to understand basic concepts of supervised machine learning and the  concepts used in making this project.
